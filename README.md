# MIPS Assembly Compiler and Simulator

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to compile MIPS assembly instructions into machine code and simulate the execution of MIPS instructions. It's intended for educational purposes, to help understand the basics of MIPS architecture and the process of assembly language compilation and execution.

## Contents

- `assembler.py`: A script that converts MIPS assembly instructions into machine code. It parses assembly instructions, categorizes them into R-type and I-type, and generates the corresponding machine code output.

- `simulator.py`: A MIPS simulator that executes machine code generated by the assembler. It simulates the execution of MIPS instructions, including arithmetic operations, memory access, and branching.

- `util.py` (hypothetical): Utility functions used by both the assembler and the simulator. This file would contain shared code, such as bit manipulation and conversion functions, if any were shared across scripts. (Note: As of the current scripts provided, there isn't a direct `util.py` file, but the functionality described might be implicitly covered within the given scripts).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `bitstring` Python package (for `simulator.py`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Install the `bitstring` package using pip:

```bash
pip install bitstring
